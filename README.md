# New photography portfolio

In progress in react, typescipt, Contenfuk, mui, framer-motion

## What it is

This portfolio is for my photography and my fronend-developer CV.

Big thing for me that you cannot easy steal the images.
Added a right click popup with Mui.

### How it looks like
It is very basic right now. Have a vision for a more storytelling page.
But that has to come when time exists :)

Landingpage
