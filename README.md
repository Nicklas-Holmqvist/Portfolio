# New photography portfolio

In progress in react, mui, framer-motion and basic html-elements

## What it is

This portfolio is for my photography and my developer CV.

## Future implements

When the basic design and functions is done I will start to implement a connection to the headless CMS Contentful.
From Contentful I will fetch all my content like texts and images.
We will see what the future will be... maby a new portfolio again but with another stack ^^
